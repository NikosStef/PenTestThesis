\end{center}

Present-day distributed computing environment where computer networks and Internet are convenient medium of communication and information exchange, security is becoming more and more of an issue. Security in computer networks and Internet have serious implication in today's dynamic work environment. With new vulnerabilities and exploits emerging rapidly, even a fully patched system or network have security flaws. There are different security measures which network/system administrator can deploy to secure the network or system, however, the best way truly to ensure that the network or system is secure, is to perform penetration testing. Penetration testing is a specialized security auditing method where a tester simulates an attack on a secured system. The goal of this is not to cause damage, but instead to identify attack surfaces, vulnerabilities, and other security weaknesses from the perspective of an attacker. Such testing can range across all aspects of a system.

We aim to provide a detailed presentation of penetration testing and its importance, while the purpose of this thesis is to research and compare the different software available for penetration testers. Also, we leverage the power of individual's code and emulate Network attack scenarios in a virtual environment. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of a well-written and detailed report, provided the necessary evidence.
